# A3_Miller_Voice_Lines
A collection of sound files from Arma 3, containing voice lines of Captain Scott Miller of the British Royal Navy. 

The sound files have been separated into three categories:

ALL - All 910 that I could find in the game files.

CLEAR - All the clips with clear voice recordings.

RADIO - All the clips with radio effects, processing, and muffling.

Some have been converted from the original .ogg file type to .wav for voice cloning purposes.
